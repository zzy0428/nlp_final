## VQA Model
The main folder for the model is located [here](https://github.com/zzy0428/nlp_final/tree/main/openvqa/models/vqabert), and the main python file for the model is [here](https://github.com/zzy0428/nlp_final/blob/main/openvqa/models/vqabert/net.py). The implementation was done using PyTorch and [OpenVQA framework](https://github.com/MILVLG/openvqa).



## Visualisation
The code to generate visualisation of attention distribution is [here](https://github.com/zzy0428/nlp_final/blob/main/utils/visualise_engine.py).

## Dataset 
For CLEVER dataset. [here] (https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/). For my own dataset, I randomly picked 50 images from OK-VQA datasets, and gave each image with one question and answer. Samples uploaded.
